SQLProvider
===========

A general .NET/Mono SQL database type provider. Current features:

* [LINQ queries](core/querying.html)
* Lazy schema exploration 
* Automatic constraint navigation
* [Individuals](core/individuals.html)
* Transactional [CRUD](core/crud.html) operations with identity support
* [Stored Procedures](core/programmability.html)
* [Functions](core/programmability.html)
* Packages (Oracle)
* [Composable Query](core/composable.html) integration
* Optional option types
* [Mapping to record types](core/mappers.html)
* Custom Operators
* Supports [Asynchronous Operations](core/async.html)
* Supports [.NET Standard / .NET Core](core/netstandard.html)
  
The provider currently has explicit implementations for the following database vendors:
 
* SQL Server
* SQLite
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* MySQL
* MsAccess
* Firebird

There is also an ODBC provider that will let you connect to any ODBC source with limited features. 

All database vendors except SQL Server and MS Access will require 3rd party ADO.NET connector objects to function. These are dynamically loaded at runtime so that the SQL provider project is not dependent on them. You must supply the location of the assemblies with the "ResolutionPath" static parameter.

SQLite is based on the .NET drivers found [here](http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki). You will need the correct version for your specific architecture and setup.

PostgreSQL is based on the Npgsql .NET drivers found [here](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/). The type provider will make frequent calls to the database. Npgsql provides a set of [performance related connection strings parameters](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html#performance) for tweaking its performance

MySQL is based on the .NET drivers found [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/1.0.html). You will need the correct version for your specific architecture and setup. You also need to specify ResolutionPath, which points to the folder containing the dll files for the MySQL driver.

Oracle is based on the current release (12.1.0.1.2) of the managed ODP.NET driver found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/index.html). However, although the managed version is recommended, it should also work with previous versions of the native driver.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates the use of the SQL type provider:

*)
// reference the type provider dll
#r "FSharp.Data.SQLProvider.dll"
open FSharp.Data.Sql

let [<Literal>] resolutionPath = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + @"..\..\files\sqlite" 
let [<Literal>] connectionString = "Data Source=" + __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + @"\northwindEF.db;Version=3"
// create a type alias with the connection string and database vendor settings
type sql = SqlDataProvider< 
              ConnectionString = connectionString,
              DatabaseVendor = Common.DatabaseProviderTypes.SQLITE,
              ResolutionPath = resolutionPath,
              IndividualsAmount = 1000,
              UseOptionTypes = true >
let ctx = sql.GetDataContext()

// To use dynamic runtime connectionString, you could use:
// let ctx = sql.GetDataContext connectionString2

// pick individual entities from the database 
let christina = ctx.Main.Customers.Individuals.``As ContactName``.``BERGS, Christina Berglund``

// directly enumerate an entity's relationships, 
// this creates and triggers the relevant query in the background
let christinasOrders = christina.``main.Orders by CustomerID`` |> Seq.toArray

let mattisOrderDetails =
    query { for c in ctx.Main.Customers do
            // you can directly enumerate relationships with no join information
            for o in c.``main.Orders by CustomerID`` do
            // or you can explicitly join on the fields you choose
            join od in ctx.Main.OrderDetails on (o.OrderId = od.OrderId)
            //  the (!!) operator will perform an outer join on a relationship
            for prod in (!!) od.``main.Products by ProductID`` do 
            // nullable columns can be represented as option types; the following generates IS NOT NULL
            where o.ShipCountry.IsSome                
            // standard operators will work as expected; the following shows the like operator and IN operator
            where (c.ContactName =% ("Matti%") && c.CompanyName |=| [|"Squirrelcomapny";"DaveCompant"|] )
            sortBy o.ShipName
            // arbitrarily complex projections are supported
            select (c.ContactName,o.ShipAddress,o.ShipCountry,prod.ProductName,prod.UnitPrice) } 
    |> Seq.toArray
