# SQL Provider for Oracle

Oracle is based on the current release (12.1.0.1.2) of the managed ODP.NET driver found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/index.html). However although the managed version is recommended it should also work with previous versions of the native driver.
