SQLProvider leverages F#'s `query {}` expression syntax to perform queries 
against the database.  Though many are supported, not all LINQ expressions are.

## Expressions

These operators perform no specific function in the code itself, rather they 
are placeholders replaced by their database-specific server-side operations.
Their utility is in forcing the compiler to check against the correct types.

let ctx = sql.GetDataContext()

let bergs = ctx.``[main].[Customers]``.Individuals.BERGS
